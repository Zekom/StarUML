<h3>ActionState</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>An action state represents the execution of an atomic action, typically the 
invocation of an operation.
An action state is a simple state with an entry action whose only exit 
transition is triggered by the implicit event of completing the execution of the 
entry action. The state therefore corresponds to the execution of the entry 
action itself and the outgoing transition is activated as soon as the action has 
completed its execution.</p>
<h4>Procedure for creating action state</h4>
<p>In order to create ActionState,</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click <b>[Toolbox] -&gt; [Activity] -&gt; [ActionState]</b> 
button.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_619.jpg"></li>
	<li>And click at the position where ActionState will be placed in the <b>
	[main window]</b>.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_620.jpg"></li>
	<li>A action state is created on the diagram and the quick dialog is shown.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_621.jpg"></li>
	<li>Enter the action state name at the quick dialog and press <b>[Enter]</b> key. 
	The result is as follows.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_622.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<h3>SubactivityState</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>A subactivity state represents the execution of a non-atomic sequence of 
steps that has some duration; that is, internally it consists of a set of 
actions and possibly waiting for<br>
events. That is, a subactivity state is a ¡°hierarchical action,¡± where an 
associated subactivity graph is executed.</p>
<h4>Procedure for creating subactivity state</h4>
<p>In order to create SubactivityState,</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click <b>[Toolbox] -&gt; [Activity] -&gt; [SubactivityState]</b> 
button.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_623.jpg"></li>
	<li>And click at the position where SubactivityState will be placed in the
	<b>[main window]</b>. A subactivity state is created and the quick dialog is shown. At 
	the quick dialog, enter the subactivity state name and press <b>[Enter]</b> key. 
	The result is as follows.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_624.jpg"></li>

	[main window]</b>.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_628.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<h3>Decision</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>A state diagram (and by derivation an activity diagram) expresses a decision 
when guard conditions are used to indicate different possible transitions that 
depend on Boolean conditions of the owning object. </p>
<h4>Procedure for creating decision</h4>
<p>In order to create Decision,</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click <b>[Toolbox] -&gt; [Activity] -&gt; [Decision]</b> 
button.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_629.jpg"></li>
	<li>And click at the position where Decision will be placed in the <b>[main 
	window]</b>. The decision is created on the diagram.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_630.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<h4>Procedure for creating decision from state</h4>
<p>In order to create decision with incoming transition from selected object, 
use shortcut creation syntax.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Double-click state. At the quick dialog, enter 
&quot;-&gt;&lt;&gt;&quot;(&quot;&lt;-&lt;&gt;&quot; for incoming from decision) string.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_631.jpg"></li>
	<li>Press <b>[Enter]</b> key and decision with outgoing transition from selected 
state is created. <br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_632.jpg"></li>
</ol>

	[main window]</b>.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_634.jpg"></li>
</ol>
<h3>Object Flow</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>An object flow is one of two types of activity edges, which are directed 
connection (flows) between activity nodes, the other being a control flow. As 
soon as the activity node at the source (tail) end of the flow is finished it 
presents tokens to the object flow at the target (arrowhead) end of the flow. An 
object flow can only carry object (data) tokens; it cannot carry control tokens. 
There are rules that specify whether tokens can flow along the object flow and 
these are determined by the type of activity node at the source and target of 
the flow. In the case of complete activities an object flow may define a weight, 
which specifies the minimum number of tokens that must flow along the object 
flow as a group.</p>
<h4>Procedure for creating object flow</h4>
<p>In order to create Object Flow,</p>
<ol>
	<li>Click <b>[Toolbox] -&gt; [Activity] -&gt; [Object Flow]</b>

	[main window]</b>. Then the quick dialog of object flow state is shown as follows.<br>
	<img border="0" src="images/ch05_636.jpg"></li>
	<li>At the quick dialog, enter the object flow state name and press <b>[Enter]</b> 
	key.<br>

</ol>
<h3>Signal Accept State</h3>
<h4>Semantics</h4>
<p>The signal accept may be shown as a concave pentagon that looks like a 
rectangle with a triangular notch in its side (either side). The signature of 
the signal is shown inside the symbol. An unlabeled transition arrow is drawn 
from the previous action state to the pentagon and another unlabeled transition 
arrow is drawn from the pentagon to the next action state. A dashed arrow may be 
drawn from an object symbol to the notch on the pentagon to show the sender of 
the signal; this is optional.</p>

</ol>
<h3>Signal Send State</h3>
<p>The sending of a signal may be shown as a convex pentagon that looks like a 
rectangle with a triangular point on one side (either side). The signature of 
the signal is shown inside the symbol. An unlabeled transition arrow is drawn 
from the previous action state to the pentagon and another unlabeled transition 
arrow is drawn from the pentagon to the next action state. A dashed arrow may be 
drawn from the point on the pentagon to an object symbol to show the receiver of 
the signal, this is optional.</p>
